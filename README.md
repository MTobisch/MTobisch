### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marvin, a freelance full-stack web developer and IT generalist based in Munich.

I've built some fun things like [Warcraft-Toys.com](https://www.warcraft-toys.com), the [ngx-dynamic-hooks](https://angular-dynamic-hooks.com) library, a [saber configurator](https://mtobisch.github.io/otssaberbuilder/?build=b1.0+s2.0+x2.0mx2.0+e3.0+c2.0mc4.0+f5.0+r6.1+p2.0) or [a personal motorcycling blog](https://www.in-fremden-gefilden.de) that I run together with my wife.

When I'm not turning pretzels into code, you may catch me riding my trusty gravel bike, going camping, or both.
